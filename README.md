## Limitations
1. **Command-Line Interface**: The app is currently limited to a command-line interface, which may not appeal to users who prefer graphical interfaces.  
2. **Google Sheets Dependency**: Data persistence relies on Google Sheets, which requires an internet connection and a Google account.  
3. **Predefined Categories**: The spending categories are fixed and cannot be customized by the user.  
4. **Manual Input**: Users must manually input their spending data, which can be time-consuming.  


---

## Room for Improvement
1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Develop a GUI to make the app more accessible and visually appealing.  
2. **Customizable Categories**: Allow users to add, remove, or modify spending categories.  
3. **Automated Data Import**: Integrate with bank accounts or financial apps to automatically import spending data.  
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Add features like trend analysis, visualizations (e.g., charts and graphs), and personalized financial recommendations.  
5. **Multi-User Support**: Enable multiple users to track their expenses within the same household.  
6. **Offline Mode**: Add support for offline data storage (e.g., using a local database) for users without consistent internet access.  
7. **Mobile App**: Develop a mobile version of the app for on-the-go expense tracking.  

---

## Testing and Debugging
### What to Look For:
1. **Input Validation**:  
   - Ensure the app handles invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric salary, negative spending amounts) gracefully.  
   - Test edge cases like empty inputs or extremely large values.  
2. **Financial Calculations**:  
   - Verify that savings, potential savings, and 12-month forecasts are calculated accurately.  
   - Test with different salary and spending values to ensure consistency.  
3. **Data Persistence**:  
   - Confirm that user data is correctly saved to and loaded from Google Sheets.  
   - Test scenarios where the Google Sheets API is unavailable or returns errors.  
4. **Error Handling**:  
   - Ensure the app provides clear error messages and recovers gracefully from exceptions.  
   - Test scenarios like network failures or invalid Google Sheets credentials.  
5. **User Experience**:  
   - Verify that the sticky menu and color-coded output work as intended.  
   - Test the app with non-technical users to identify usability issues.  

### Debugging Tips:
- Use print statements or a debugger to trace the flow of execution and identify issues.  
- Test individual functions in isolation to ensure they work as expected.  
- Monitor API responses and error logs when interacting with Google Sheets.  
- Validate data at each step (e.g., after input collection, before saving to Google Sheets).
